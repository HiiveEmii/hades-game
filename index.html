        <h3 class="tagTitle">How to play ?</h3>
            <p> The combat system of the game is a simply system where
                 enemies have Hp bars and have the ability to use different
                  attacts aswell as dodging. The player has more options on the other hand </p>

            <p>The game provides the user a choice of weapons when crossed
                apon they can obtain This is good as it allows the user to 
                again different experiences from others and provides them with
                more of a personal experience. This is also good as it provides 
                the game with more replay ability giving the player a chance to
                go back to test a different weapon.</p>

            <p>The gold system is used to allow the player to have the ability to 
                purchas rewards for their hard work by deafeating monsters and taking 
                out bosses which give higer amounts of gold. The gold allows the player 
                to purchase items in the shop which allow the player either to gain more
                hp or purchase items such as weapons and keys. </p>

            <p>The player takes the role of Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld,
                who is trying to escape the realm to get away from his unloving father, 
                Hades, and reach his mother Persephone in the mortal world. His quest is 
                supported by the other Olympians, who grant him gifts to help fight the beings
                that protect the exit from the Underworld. </p>

            <p> The game world is divided between four main dungeons, each representing 
                one of the regions of the Underworld, namely Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium,
                and the Temple of Styx, with each new region being unlocked upon clearing
                the previous locale. </p>

            <p>The player starts a run-through of the game by trying to fight their way
                through a number of rooms; the rooms are drawn from a pool of pre-determined
                layouts, but their order and the enemies that appear are randomly determined. </p>

            <p> LThe Binding of Isaac is a top-down dungeon crawler game,
                presented using two-dimensional sprites, in which the playe
                r controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore 
                the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ 
                in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other
                attributes. </p>

            <p>On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters
                in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly 
                done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick
                shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage
                enemies and clear out parts of the room </p>

            <p>Once a room is cleared of monsters, it will remain clear, allowing the player
                to re-trace their way through the level, though once they move onto the next
                level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy
                power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new 
                weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies.  </p>

                   <p>All these  feafures are much  like hades  and provide player  with a fun 
                     new  experiance  for anyone who  likes  hades  </p>
